# My First Smart Contract

This is my first smart contract ever powered by [Buildspace](https://app.buildspace.so/).

It's deployed to Ethereum's rinkeby testnet and can be found on [Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x87C26c69F0991D23A45991B2fD81dFd394c68221).  
The corresponding React web app is deployed via [Replit](https://replit.com/) and can be viewed [here](https://waveportal-starter-project.ysfaran.repl.co/).

Feel free to check it out, it hopefully is pretty self-explanatory ðŸ™‚.
